# Week 10 Day 44

## Broken

### Jen's Wednesday

### Joyce's Wendesday
Squashed the PR where the bundle update shows the previous version of gem and sent it over as PR to the bundler repo.

Also sent the rspec test for the bundle outdated with invalid gem name issue as PR to the bundler repo. This one got merged in yay.

The bundle update tests broke. Made fixes to the tests since we moved bundle update functionality to bundle update --all and bundle update should just print usage instructions.

Worked on article entry.
