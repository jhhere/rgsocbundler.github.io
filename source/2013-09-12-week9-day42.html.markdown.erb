# Week 9 Day 42

## ~special~

### Jen's Thursday

### Joyce's Thursday
Learned/Read about the object `nil` and the `defined?` method.

The `nil` and `false` object are the only values that evaluates to false.

**`nil` is a ~special~ object.**

**The `defined?` method is a ~special~ operator.**

But, when you set a variable to nil and send it as an argument to defined? it returns what the object/variable is.

You can give defined? an argument or any random thing and it works. We didn’t set @foo to anything and gave it to the defined? method and it still returns something, `nil`. Next, we set @foo = nil. Give it to defined? method and it tells us it is an “instance-variable.”

    >> defined?(@foo)
    => nil
    >> @foo = nil
    => nil
    >> defined?(@foo)
    => "instance-variable"
