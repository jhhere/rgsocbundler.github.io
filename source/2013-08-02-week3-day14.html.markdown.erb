## More Gem Production and Testing
 
![Alt gems](http://d33y93cfm0wb4z.cloudfront.net/Lauren/Homepage_Images/Gems_and_birthmonth.jpg)

We were both reading about Rspec in the Pragmatic Programmer's **The RSpec Book** (Behaviour-Driven Development with RSpec, Cucumber, and Friends) by David Chelimsky

We also were looking at Peepcode's Rspec Screencast.

### Jen's Friday
---------------------------------
I worked on my gem last night at the Ruby Study Group and I swear it was working. This morning I ran it and ERROR. I tried so many different things to fix it that I finally lost the thread. I decided to just go through our tutorial and create it again from scratch but there are definitely some missing parts we need to fill in.

I spent some more time in my .bashrc file. Apparently I have become obsessed with it. My problem was that it was hard to read my errors because my prompt was the same color as everything else so it all blurred together. I used a combination of this site: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Color_Bash_Prompt and this site: http://ubuntugenius.wordpress.com/2011/07/11/how-to-change-the-command-line-prompt-colour-in-the-ubuntulinux-terminal/ and the Terminal's Profile Preferences a. Hooray, it is finally readable.

### Joyce's Friday
-----------------------------------
I read the Rspec and bdd page on jumpstartlab’s website. I worked on a rspec test to pass for the Lorem gem with the help of Jessica Suttles and Andre Arko. I assumed I wrote the test wrong and didn’t really look at the error messages. With their help, going over the 2 failures that came up, I got a test to pass. Yay. I had glossed and skimmed the test, which led to reading on how to read error messages. :sweat_smile:
