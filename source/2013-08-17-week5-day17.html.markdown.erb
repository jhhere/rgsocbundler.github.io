# Week 4 Day 17

## How I love ya, Friscoooo

All 3 of us flew to [San Francisco](http://youtu.be/WnjufR8GDcw) today.

While Jessica attended a speaker's dinner we went to [Curry Up Now](http://www.curryupnow.com/menus) in the Mission then we saw the band [Gaucho](http://www.gauchojazz.com/about.html) at [Amnesia](http://amnesiathebar.com/newp/) Here's their [myspace](https://myspace.com/gauchosf) Their sax player plays with Tom Waits. Culture and inspiration.

[The Hilton](http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/california/hilton-san-francisco-union-square-SFOFHHH/index.html) where we are staying is beautiful and the rooms are so comfortable and posh. Thanks Distill, Engine Yard and Rails Girls Summer of Code! We are so ready for the conference tomorrow. There are so many interesting talks to attend.
